    Welcome to CodeGen Hub - A platform for training and using code generation models with Hugging Face integration.

    ### Core Features:
    - Upload and preprocess Python code datasets for model training
    - Configure and train models with customizable parameters
    - Generate code predictions using trained models through an interactive interface
    - Monitor training progress with visualizations and detailed logs
    - Seamless integration with Hugging Face Hub for model management

    Navigate through the different sections using the sidebar menu.
