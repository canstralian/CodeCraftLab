### Bug Report and Analysis

#### Syntax Errors

**Issue:** None Detected
- **Context:** The provided code appears to be syntactically correct. All function calls and statements are properly formatted, and there are no missing parentheses or other syntax issues.
- **Conclusion:** The code is free from syntax errors.

#### Runtime Errors

**Issue:** Potential ImportError
- **Context:** The code imports `set_page_config` and `display_sidebar` from a module named `utils`.
- **Description:** If the `utils` module is not present or does not contain these functions, an `ImportError` will occur at runtime.
- **Suggested Fix:** Ensure that the `utils` module is correctly implemented and accessible in the environment where this code is executed.

**Issue:** KeyError on Session State Access
- **Context:** Accessing `st.session_state` variables without checking their existence.
- **Description:** If the session state is modified externally or if the app is restarted, accessing keys that are not initialized may raise a `KeyError`.
- **Suggested Fix:** Use `st.session_state.get('key', default_value)` to safely access session state variables.

#### Memory Leaks

**Issue:** None Detected
- **Context:** The code does not exhibit any obvious memory leaks.
- **Description:** The session state variables are initialized properly, and there are no infinite loops or excessive memory allocations.
- **Conclusion:** The code is efficient in terms of memory usage.

#### Code Optimization Tips

**Issue:** Inefficient Calculation of Active Training Jobs
- **Context:** The line calculating `active_jobs` uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function.
- **Description:** While this is generally efficient, if `st.session_state.training_progress` contains a large number of entries, consider optimizing this by storing the count of running jobs in the session state whenever a job starts or ends.
- **Suggested Fix:** Maintain a counter in the session state that updates whenever a job's status changes, reducing the need to iterate through the entire dictionary.

**Issue:** Redundant Initialization of Session State Variables
- **Context:** Each session state variable is checked and initialized separately.
- **Description:** This could be streamlined into a single function that initializes all necessary session state variables.
- **Suggested Fix:** Create a function to initialize session state variables in a loop, improving code maintainability.

#### Deprecated Functions

**Issue:** None Detected
- **Context:** The code does not appear to use any deprecated functions.
- **Conclusion:** All functions used are current and supported in the latest versions of Streamlit.

### Summary

The provided code is largely well-structured and free from syntax errors. However, it is essential to ensure that the `utils` module is correctly implemented to avoid runtime errors. Memory management appears efficient, but there are opportunities for optimization, particularly in the handling of active training jobs and the initialization of session state variables. Overall, the code is functional, but implementing the suggested improvements could enhance its robustness and maintainability.
### Performance Bottlenecks

**Issue:** Inefficient State Management
- **Context:** The code initializes multiple session state variables in separate conditional blocks.
- **Description:** Each check for the existence of a key in `st.session_state` incurs overhead. If many keys are added, this can lead to performance degradation.
- **Suggested Fix:** Use a loop or a dictionary to initialize all session state variables at once, reducing repetitive code and improving performance.

### Variable Naming Consistency

**Issue:** Inconsistent Naming Conventions
- **Context:** The variable names in `st.session_state` are consistent, but the comments sometimes use different terminologies.
- **Description:** The comments refer to "datasets," "trained models," and "training logs" without a consistent format.
- **Suggested Fix:** Ensure that all comments use the same terminology and style for clarity, e.g., always use plural forms or consistent casing.

### Comments Review

**Issue:** Redundant Comments
- **Context:** Many comments describe what the code does in a straightforward manner.
- **Description:** While comments are generally helpful, some are overly verbose and do not add significant value.
- **Suggested Fix:** Keep comments concise and focus on explaining why something is done rather than what is being done, especially for self-explanatory code.

### Potential Refactoring Spots

**Issue:** Repetitive Initialization Logic
- **Description:** The initialization of session state variables is repetitive and can be refactored.
- **Suggested Fix:** Create a function that initializes session state variables based on a predefined dictionary of defaults, reducing redundancy.

### API Misuse

**Issue:** Potential Misuse of Streamlit API
- **Context:** The code assumes that the `set_page_config` function is called without parameters.
- **Description:** If `set_page_config` requires parameters for proper configuration, this could lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Suggested Fix:** Review the `set_page_config` function documentation to ensure it is being used correctly with necessary parameters.

### Code Smells

**Issue:** Lack of Error Handling
- **Context:** The code does not include any error handling for user inputs or session state manipulations.
- **Description:** This could lead to crashes or unhandled exceptions if users provide invalid data or if the session state is corrupted.
- **Suggested Fix:** Implement try-except blocks around critical operations to gracefully handle potential errors.

### Compatibility Issues

**Issue:** Dependency on External Module
- **Context:** The code imports `set_page_config` and `display_sidebar` from a `utils` module.
- **Description:** If the `utils` module is not available or has breaking changes, the app will fail to run.
- **Suggested Fix:** Ensure that the `utils` module is properly documented and version-controlled, and consider adding checks to verify its availability.

### Code Style Violations

**Issue:** PEP 8 Compliance
- **Context:** The code generally follows PEP 8, but there are minor issues.
- **Description:** For example, the comments could be more concise, and there are instances of excessive line length.
- **Suggested Fix:** Review the code for line lengths exceeding 79 characters and ensure comments are succinct and to the point, adhering to PEP 8 guidelines.
